# Dotfiles

Repository containing all my personal dotfile configurations.

### General Vim Usage
- General config to source from for vim emulators on IDEs
- Quick edits to build & run cpp & python files
- FZF(fuzzy searching for projects) is the only plugin required for a
  minimalistic config

### General Emacs Usage
- General note taking & tracking TODOs/questions with Org-mode
- Managing project version control through Magit
- Designing documents through org-mode/Latex (via Auctex)
